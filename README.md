## Overview

This project is a Telegram bot that utilizes Google Gemini for generating responses based on user inputs. The bot is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind, using various software design patterns to enhance its architecture.

## Software Design Patterns Implemented

### Anuar: Singleton and Adapter

- **Singleton Pattern**: 
  - The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a single instance of the bot is created throughout the application. This helps maintain a consistent state and reduces resource overhead.
  - Implementation: The `bot_instance.py` file creates a single instance of the `Bot` class, ensuring that all parts of the application use the same instance.

    ```python
    # bot_instance.py
    from aiogram import Bot
    from config import BOT_TOKEN

    bot = Bot(token=BOT_TOKEN)  # Singleton instance of the Bot
    ```

- **Adapter Pattern**:
  - The Adapter pattern is used to connect the bot's internal logic with the Telegram API. It allows us to adapt Telegram’s message structure to our bot’s command system without hardcoding Telegram-specific logic in our command classes.
  - Implementation: The `handlers/command_handler.py` file acts as an adapter by converting incoming `Message` objects from Telegram into formats that our command logic can process.

    ```python
    # handlers/command_handler.py
    @router.message(F.text)
    async def cmd_default(message: Message):
        await DefaultCommand().execute(message)  # Adapts the Telegram message for command execution
    ```

### Assem: Factory and Command

- **Factory Pattern**:
  - The Factory pattern is utilized for creating command instances dynamically based on user input. This pattern abstracts the instantiation process, allowing for easier addition of new commands without modifying existing code.
  - Implementation: The command handler factory method in `commands/command_factory.py` can create various command objects based on the incoming message.

    ```python
    # commands/command_factory.py
    def create_command(command_name: str):
        if command_name == 'help':
            return HelpCommand()
        elif command_name == 'history':
            return HistoryCommand()
        # Add other commands here
    ```

- **Command Pattern**:
  - The Command pattern is used to encapsulate all the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event. Each command corresponds to a specific bot action and can be executed independently.
  - Implementation: Each command class in `commands/concrete_commands.py` implements an `execute` method that defines the action to be performed.

    ```python
    # commands/concrete_commands.py
    class HelpCommand(BaseCommand):
        async def execute(self, message: Message):
            await message.answer(help_text)  # Encapsulates the action to send help text
    ```

### Maxim: Observer and Facade

- **Observer Pattern**:
  - The Observer pattern is implemented to allow multiple components to listen for updates or events without tightly coupling them to the source of the events. This is particularly useful for handling changes in user history or bot status.
  - Implementation: The bot may use an observer mechanism to notify various parts of the application when user history is updated, promoting loose coupling.

    ```python
    # Example observer registration
    user_history_observer.register(observer)
    ```

- **Facade Pattern**:
  - The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with multiple components. This can be particularly useful when interfacing with the Gemini API and the database.
  - Implementation: A facade class in `services/facade.py` may be used to wrap the interaction logic with the Gemini API and database calls, allowing other components to interact with it without needing to know the details.

    ```python
    # services/facade.py
    class BotFacade:
        def __init__(self, api, db):
            self.api = api
            self.db = db
        
        def generate_response(self, user_input):
            # Simplified method to interact with the API and database
            pass
    ```

## Conclusion

By implementing these design patterns, we have created a robust and maintainable architecture for our Telegram bot. Each team member’s contributions play a crucial role in the overall functionality and scalability of the project.
